Radiation Monitoring App

I wrote a Python program that Takes radiation readings and creates a graph representation of it on a flask web app.
This is not perfect as it still uses readings imported randomly from created python class. I intend to test this on a a real gieger counter too, though frontend also not so perfect (Any collaboration on this, would be genuinely appreciated) it's still going to undergo certain improvements. 

Hit me up on instructions on how to test this.. It's pretty easy to check it out too tho.

Thank you. ReadMe file will be updated periodically.
